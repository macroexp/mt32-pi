# Working on pim-32

pim-32 is a community continuation of [dwhinham/mt32-pi](https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi): a bare-metal MT-32 (Munt) and SoundFont (FluidSynth) synth for Raspberry Pi, built on the [Circle](https://github.com/rsta2/circle) framework via circle-stdlib. It is not Linux. "Updating the base" means updating Circle.

**Start every session by reading the punchlist's "Current state / handoff" section:** https://claude.ai/artifact/QZmVguavkG1sY6nDBfaEXs. It says what's released, what's open, and what to do next. Update that section before you finish, and tick or add punchlist items as work completes or new tasks turn up.

## Layout

- `src/`, `include/`: mt32-pi itself. `src/synth/mt32synth.cpp` wraps Munt, `src/synth/soundfontsynth.cpp` wraps FluidSynth, `src/mt32pi.cpp` holds the audio, MIDI and UI tasks (one per core).
- `external/`: submodules. `circle-stdlib` (v16, Circle Step 45), `munt` (libmt32emu 2.8.3), `fluidsynth` (~2.3.1), `inih` (r62).
- `patches/`: local patches applied to submodules by the `Makefile` (`APPLY_PATCH`) and reversed by `make mrproper` (`REVERSE_PATCH`). Patch names carry the submodule version they apply to.
- `Config.mk`, `Kernel.mk`, `Makefile`: build. `BOARD` is one of `pi2`, `pi3`, `pi3-64` (default; also Pi Zero 2 W), `pi4`, `pi4-64`.
- `sdcard/`: files shipped on the SD card (`config.txt`, `mt32-pi.cfg`).
- `scripts/`: user-facing updater/installer (Python, linted in CI). `scripts/dev/munt-ab/`: Munt A/B render and partial-report tools (see its README).
- `BUILDING.md`: local build setup, including the toolchain download.

## Build

```sh
make BOARD=pi3-64            # kernel8.img; HDMI_CONSOLE=1 shows the log on HDMI
make mrproper                # reverse patches, clean everything (do this before switching branches)
```

- **Toolchain: Arm GNU Toolchain 11.3.rel1** (`aarch64-none-elf` and `arm-none-eabi`). Do not move to GCC 13+ for releases yet: GCC 15 builds on Circle 45 caused boot failures (ROMs not found, synth init failing), "sync" exception crashes and silent SysEx-uploaded timbres on a Pi Zero 2 W, while GCC 11 builds of the same code are clean. The GCC 15 compatibility patches (`NEWLIB_COMPAT_CFLAGS`, `circle-stdlib-16-extra-newlib-cflags.patch`, `circle-45-gcc13-hosted-cxx.patch`) stay so the toolchain can move forward after the Circle upgrade, with a hardware soak test.
- Munt is built with `-Ofast`. Offline renders show this is bit-for-bit close to `-O2` for Munt 2.7.0 and 2.8.3.
- Each core's stack is 128 KB (`KERNEL_STACK_SIZE`), with no guard. Munt's `doRenderAndConvertStreams` frame is ~98 KB on the audio core, so keep large buffers off that stack.

## Git and GitHub

- Branch from `main`, one pull request per change; one dependency upgrade per commit.
- **Submodules:** after checking out or rebasing, run `git submodule update`. Never `git commit -a` or `git add .` while a submodule is checked out at another branch's version; stage files by name and check `git show --stat HEAD` before pushing. (This once slipped a Munt bump into a changelog commit.)
- **Pull requests:** create and merge them with the REST API (`gh api repos/macroexp/mt32-pi/pulls ...`, `gh api -X PUT .../pulls/N/merge`). GraphQL (`gh pr create`) is blocked from Claude sessions. CI status: `gh api repos/macroexp/mt32-pi/commits/<sha>/check-runs` (the Actions API is blocked).
- **Releases:** Claude sessions can't push tags or create releases. Date the version in `CHANGELOG.md` (`## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` plus the compare link at the bottom) in its own PR, then the maintainer publishes a release from `main` with tag `vX.Y.Z` in the GitHub UI. CI builds the tag, extracts that version's CHANGELOG section as the notes and attaches `pim-32-X.Y.Z.zip`.
- Version tags must sort above upstream's v0.13.1 for the updater. The device still reports itself as `mt32-pi` (boot log, FTP banner) because the updater parses that.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml`: lint (black, isort, flake8, shellcheck), builds for pi2, pi3-64, pi4-64 (packaged) plus pi3, pi4 (build check only), and a package job that fetches GeneralUser GS v2.0.3 (pinned by commit and SHA-256). Actions are pinned to tagged versions.

## Testing

- **Hardware (maintainer):** Pi Zero 2 W, FiiO Taishan I²S DAC, SSD1306 I²C OLED, simple buttons, HDMI monitor for `HDMI_CONSOLE=1` builds. `mt32-pi.cfg`: I²S, chunk_size 256, Wi-Fi on, RTP and UDP MIDI on, USB off, rom_set old (MT-32 v1.x ROM), verbose on. MIDI comes from Cakewalk on a PC. The maintainer has SD cards with stock 0.13.1 for comparison and can record audio.
- **Regression test:** Laura Bow 2 (Sierra). Send the setup `AMONRA.SYX`, then play `LB2MT.MID`. Part 5 (MIDI ch 6) uses the uploaded timbre M09 "BanjoLB2"; measures 164-188 are a good dense/sparse stretch. These files are Sierra's and aren't in the repo; ask the maintainer to attach them.
- **Munt changes:** run `scripts/dev/munt-ab/run.sh` (renders old vs new with the maintainer's ROMs; `--report`, `--solo`, `--sysex`).
- **Debug kernels:** branch `debug-midi-log` (never merge it) adds `MIDI_DEBUG_CHANNEL=N` logging, timbre checksums and PCM checksums. Its heavy HDMI logging disturbs audio and causes audible distortion, so never judge sound quality on a debug kernel.
- Always hand the maintainer builds that differ from a known-good build in exactly one respect, and state what that respect is.
